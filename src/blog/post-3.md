# First Blog Post

Here is a blog blost that I should write one day to talk about some of my personal projects

```javascript
console.log('hello world');
const name = 'Freddy';
export class Person {
	constructor(name) {
		this.name = name;
	}
}
const person = new Person(name);
```

```html
<h1>test</h1>
```

```json
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Smith",
  "age": 25
}
```
